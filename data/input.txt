The data tracker application is meant to display the status of the various X01 projects in terms of where the data is in the workflow. Namely, the goal is to understand if data has been uploaded, processed, harmonized, and is available by the investigators. This will allow for investigators to be able to determine when data will be ready for analysis. Additionally, it will add a layer of transparency so all invested parties can see if/when data is not moving smoothly through the pipeline. Both the phenotypic and genotypic data will be tracked as both are essential for any analysis.
